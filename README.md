# Large Language Models' Watermarking: Master Thesis

This GitHub repository serves as a collection of code & text materials that may be used in experiments' reproduction purposes.

We describe the files here in the following way:

1. SH scripts - text files of .sh format that provide different hyperparameter settings for WLLM and SWEET models in purposes of watermarked text generation and presence of watermark detection in machine-generated texts (to estimate true positive rates) & human-written texts (to estimate false positive rates).

2. WLLM_SWEET_additionals - additional files to generate and detect watermarks in WLLM and SWEET models.

3. Generations and evaluations - results of generating watermarked texts and detecting presence of watermark in machine-generated & human-written texts in WLLM and SWEET models. Moreover, it containes generation of non-watermarked text (by StarCoder) and detection of watermark presence in this non-watermarked text.

4. Main Experiments - Python file that contains code necessary to run the experiments.
